# ✉️ AI Email Generator

A full-stack AI-powered web application that helps users **draft professional, well-structured emails** for academic, corporate, and formal communication — while preserving **authenticity and user control**.

Instead of auto-sending emails, the app opens a **pre-filled Gmail draft** (on both desktop and mobile), allowing users to review, edit, attach files, and manually click **Send**.

## 🧠 Why “Open in Gmail” Instead of Auto-Send?

This project intentionally avoids auto-sending emails to preserve:

- ✅ Sender authenticity (email is sent from the user’s own Gmail)
- ✅ Academic & professional credibility
- ✅ User trust and control
- ✅ Ethical AI usage

This design mirrors real-world tools like **Grammarly** and **Notion AI**, where AI assists in writing — not impersonating users.
